        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pelmeni is a russian dumpling dish made with ground beef and dough. Typically made in large bulks to freeze and serve later.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup warm water</1i> 
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>18 ounces ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons ice-cold water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup;
             add enough water to fill to 1 cup.
              Pour into a bowl, add 3
              cups flour, and knead into a smooth, elastic dough.
               Cover with a kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour. </li>
            <li>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a bowl
             and mix filling thoroughly by hand or using a fork. </li>
            <li>Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface and cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a wine glass. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a towel to avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling on one side of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together. </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small batches of frozen pelmeni into simmering water. Cook and stir until the meat is cooked and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon. </li>
